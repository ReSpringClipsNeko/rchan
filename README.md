# rchan
rchan(r酱) is the package update check bot of ClipsNeko Linux.

## Usage
In that repository, contains upper level of the PKGBUILDs...

Run `rchan`, it will check PKGBUILD update by the remote PKGBUILD url in `rchan.yaml`.

## Why not lilac
[lilac](https://github.com/archlinuxcn/lilac) is the bot of [archlinuxcn](https://github.com/archlinuxcn).

It is too heavy, our package is not too much so that have to use lilac.

I feel that in the near future, when the number of packages reaches a certain level, we will migrate to lilac.
